"The two F110-GE-400 afterburning turbo-fans powering the F-14B are "

"The AFTC controls both the engine itself as well as the variable exhaust "
"nozzles controlling the engine exhaust gases. Additionally, the AICS (Air "
"Inlet Control System) helps by controlling the engine airflow for an even "
