"The F-14 Tomcat can trace its origin back to the 1950's and the US Navy's "
"need for a carrier based long range interceptor to fill the Fleet Air "
"Defence role. It was decided that it needed an aircraft with a more advanced "
"and longer ranged radar as well as longer ranged air-to-air missile than the "
"F-4 Phantom."
msgstr ""
"F-14“雄猫”可以一直追溯到上世纪50年代，美国海军急需一架长航程舰载截击机来填补"
"舰队防空职能的空缺。这项计划最终结论是，海军需要一架比F-4“鬼怪”更先进、雷达探"
"测距离更远，以及空空导弹射程更长的战斗机。"

"The Navy was directed, by then, defense secretary Robert McNamara to join "
"the Tactical Fighter Experimental or TFX program to procure this aircraft in "
"a joint venture with the US Air Force. The Navy was opposed to this from the "

"Navy's expectations."

"到那时，海军受国防部长罗伯特·麦克纳马拉的指示，参加战术战斗机实验，也就是TFX"

"Grumman, which had been brought on board by General Dynamics for the Navy "
"F-111B, was eventually awarded a contract to begin developement of an "
"aircraft more suited to the Navy's requirements. This led to the design that "
"would eventually become the F-14, carrying over the radar (AN/AWG-9) and "
"missiles (AIM-54 Phoenix) from the failed F-111B project."
msgstr ""
"由与通用公司共同参与TFX项目的格鲁曼公司，最终获得了这份为海军开发更合适舰载机"

"The F-14 Tomcat first flew on the 21st of December 1970 and entered service "
"on the 22nd of September 1974. The name \"Tomcat\" follows Grumman's "
